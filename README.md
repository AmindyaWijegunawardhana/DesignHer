*Why I selected this topic*
I created Tech Her Path to empower and guide girls who aspire to enter the world of technology. As a female engineering student myself, I’ve seen how many young women face challenges in accessing career guidance, confidence-building resources, and a clear direction in tech-related fields.

This website aims to be a supportive platform where girls can explore career paths, find inspiration, and take their first steps into the tech industry with clarity and confidence. Tech Her Path is my small contribution toward bridging the gender gap in STEM and encouraging more girls to follow their passion for technology.
